        <h4>Project Idea</h4>
        <p>This project is Passport Application tracking app that allows users to see how their application going whether their application is being procced or under assessment, the system can track when the person will be getting their passport and how the application is coming if they need to submit more document etc. 
          for users to use this app they will need to download the app on their phone, create an account enter all their details and the application number for them to see the application processing.
          What Motivated me to come up this project idea is that I have recently applied for my Australian passport and since covid19 hit austlian passport applications has been taking long to get, 
          and for the applicant to know how their application is coming or if they need to provide more document the office have  to call the applicant or send them email and I think it would be a lot easier if there was an app that would do all that for you. 
          So you don't have to miss any update and you can also see the processing time of you application and 
          if the office ever need more information from you.
          The great feather about this Mobile app i has real timee tracking,it is user friendly for young and older people
          it is time efficient so you don't have to wait around for a call or emeil from the office.
          it is also secure no one can access your personal information.
          	Prevent unrecognised users 
          	Unlimited users
          To create this app, I will need to write out the features for the app and create the graphic design for my app that includes a set of development tools for creating cross-platform, data-centric, business and consumer grade native mobile apps such as html, JavaScript or CSS I will need desktop or laptop and I will need to install some software to create my Mobile App.
          if my Passport tracking Mobile app project is successful, it there are many advantages such as users will enjoy this service because they can access 24 hours, it is also free of charge and unlimited number of users
